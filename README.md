## TODO APP MADE WITH REACT.JS
This react app has a search feature, update feature and add feature.
Unfortunately, there is a small bug.
In order for you to update the value of select, do this:
1. Select priority from dropdown menu.
2. Start editing the value in the input field and the select element will update itself to the value you selected in step 1.
3. After you are done, just click submit and that's it!!
